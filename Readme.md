# Readme 

This is the github repo of Stanford's Causality in Cognition Lab homepage.

## Initial setup

### Cloning the homepage repo

- Make a github account [here](https://github.com/).
- Ask Ari ([aribeller@gmail.com](mailto:aribeller@gmail.com)) or Tobi ([gerstenberg@stanford.edu](mailto:gerstenberg@stanford.edu)) to be added as a collaborator to the repo.
- Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you'd like to clone the repository.
- Run this command in your terminal: 
```
git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/tobiasgerstenberg/homepage.git
```
- Check that you're on the master branch both in the root directory, as well as in the subfolder public.
- In the root directory, run the following commands:
```
git branch 
cd public
git branch 
cd ../themes/academic
git branch
```
You should be on the branch `master` for all three of them. If not, then type `git checkout master` to change the branch (in each of the three directories).

### Installing `hugo`

- First, install `homebrew` following the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).
- The current version of the homepage works with hugo version 0.55.5. To install this particular version, run the following commands (see [this post](https://www.fernandomc.com/posts/brew-install-legacy-hugo-site-generator/) for more info).

```
brew unlink hugo
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/2d7e602ad4c26d1d509e5f6c17fd5911323788a3/Formula/hugo.rb
```

You might get the following error:
```
Error: Calling Installation of hugo from a GitHub commit URL is disabled! Use 'brew extract hugo' to stable tap on GitHub instead.
```
in which case run the following commands to install from tap instead (see [this thread](https://discourse.brew.sh/t/has-brew-install-force-formula-raw-path-been-taken-out/8793) for more details).
```
brew unlink hugo
brew tap-new company/team
brew extract --version 0.55.5 hugo company/team
brew install company/team/hugo@0.55.5
brew link hugo@0.55.5
```
- Confirm that `hugo version` shows `v0.55.5`.

```

- `content`: contains markdown files used to render the page 
	+ `home`: all widgets displayed on the first page 
	+ `member`: individual markdown file for each lab member 
	+ `publication`: individual file for each publication
		* these files are generated by the cic parser, and can subsequently be edited 

- `static`: contains all the files (papers, images, datasets, ...) in several subfolders

## How to clone

The hugo setup uses a submodule to differentiate the public facing website from the private developer's side. To clone the repo and appropriately sync the supermodule with the submodule, do the following:

- Clone the homepage repo [here](https://github.com/tobiasgerstenberg/homepage).
- Delete the "public" folder.
- Clone the [submodule](https://github.com/tobiasgerstenberg/tobiasgerstenberg.github.io) into the homepage folder.
- Rename the submodule to public.

## Update the hompage 

If you have any trouble getting things to work, feel free to post an issue on the github repo. 

First navigate to the root directory of the homepage in your terminal. To pull the most recent changes from the github repository by running: 

```
bash download.sh 
```

To submit any changes you've made, run:

```
bash upload.sh 'message'
```

Please type a 'message' that communicates what changes you've made. 

### Add yourself to the homepage

#### Add your picture

- Make sure that the image is not too large (ideally smaller than 1mb).
- Ideally, it should be square. 
- Name the picture `firstname_lastname.jpg` and put it into `static/img/members/`. 

#### Add your CV 

- Name your CV `firstname_lastname.pdf` and put it in `static/cv/`.

#### Add your personal page 

You can create a new webpage by adding a new markdown file with your name into the `content/member/` folder. Just copy the `tobias_gerstenberg.md` file, rename it, and adapt it to your needs. 

#### Update the people page 

In `content/home/people.md` add yourself as a new member. You can simply copy the template. If you don't have twitter or any of the other services, just leave it empty (e.g. `twitter = ""`). 

### Add a publication 

#### Update the lab's bibtex file 

- The lab's bibtex file is located here: `static/bibtex/cic_papers.bib`. 
- Add the bibtex entry of your publication to the file. 
- Make sure to add an abstract to your entry. 

#### Parse the bibtex file to update the homepage

In your terminal, navigate to the root folder and run: 

```
python3 parse_bib_cic.py -i static/bibtex/cic_papers.bib
```

This will create a new markdown file in the `content/publication/` folder for each new publication that was added to the lab's bibdesk repository. The markdown file is named `bibentryid.md`, for example `gerstenberg2016csm.md`. 

The parser also puts individual `.bib` files for each publication into `static/files/citations/`. 

#### Add a pdf of your paper 

Add a pdf of your paper to `static/papers/` using the same name as the markdown file above (e.g. `gerstenberg2016csm.pdf`).

#### Tweak the publication page 

Navigate to `content/publication/` to open the publication. Adapt the links: 

```
# Links (optional).
url_pdf = "papers/gerstenberg2016csm.pdf"
url_preprint = ""
url_code = ""
url_dataset = ""
url_project = ""
url_slides = "https://link_to_slides.pdf"
url_video = ""
url_poster = ""
url_source = ""
```

You can also generate new links by changing `url_custom = []` to 

```
url_custom = [
{name = "link_name1", url = "url1"},
{name = "link_name2", url = "url2"}
]
```

You can also add an image to go with the paper by putting it into `static/img/publications/` and linking to by adapting the `image =""` parameter (e.g. `image ="publications/gerstenberg2016csm.png"`).

## Develop the page 

Here is a list of the key files to play around with: 

- `config.toml`: Configuration file 
	+ navigation bar 
	+ what's displayed on home page 
- `homepage/layouts`: 
	+ contains subfolders with files to adapt the different widgets and pages
- `/static/css/custom.css`:
	+ css file to adapt any of the stylings 

## Test the page

## Some useful things to know

### Commenting 

- html: `<-- comment -->` 
- markdown: `# comment`
- css: `/* comment */`
- hugo: `// comment`

### Bibtex 

- For the abstracts in the bibtex files, make sure to typeset `"` as `''` (i.e. with two separate quote marks). Otherwise, the metadata in the corresponding `publication.md` file is incorrect.
